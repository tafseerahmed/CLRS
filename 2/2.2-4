To modify any algorithm to have a good best-case running time we simply check if the task we are performing is required or not i.e
check whether or not it satisfies the goal of the algorithm.
for example in case of sorting if the elements are already sorted we simply check for that and if its sorted then no other operation
is required leading to a best case running time of Î˜(n).
