Selection-Sort(A[],n):
for j = 1 to n-1
  min = A[j]
  i = j+1 to n
    if A[i] < A[j]
    min = i
  swap (A[i],A[min])
  
Loop Invariant: At the beginning of the ith iteration we have the i-1 smallest elements in sorted order stored in A[1] to A[i-1].
                At the end of the ith iteration the sorted invariant extends by one.
 
 
 It needs to run for the first n-1 elements only because at the end of n-1 iterations we reach A[n-1] and sort it with A[n] completing
 the sorting of the array.
 
 
 Best-case = Worst-cast = Î˜(n^2).
